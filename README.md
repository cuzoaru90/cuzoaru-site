# Chuck Uzoaruâ€™s Personal Web site

This website is written entirely from scratch with raw HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and additional assets. The project is one of many that I created for web design experience. The code was uploaded to the web with premium hosting, but it has been taken down. I plan to replace it with a Modified WordPress template to make it look better.

## Purpose

The site is a portfolio hub that I can use to showcase my skills as a developer and archive projects that I create on the side. 

The source code serves an important purpose, which is to demonstrate my coding style. I am very dedicated to writing effective code that follows proper software engineering principles.
