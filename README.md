# Raw HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

## Clarification
I am doing a README update, because I need to make this clear. The code in this repo is NOT hosted at www.chuckuzoaru.com. 
This is code written in 2016 entirely from scratch without any boilerplates or templates. It is a primitive version that has not been hosted in quite some time.

For the current site, you will find that in the GitHub repo named hosted-site. It uses a professional base template that I have heavily modified for the sake of quality work. My actual current site (at chuckuzoaru.com) has been hosted and modified over the years. I've been focusing entirely on basic front-end development and Java programming throughout the year.

I recognize that the name of this repo may have caused confusion.
